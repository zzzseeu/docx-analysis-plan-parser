name: bioinformatics-diagnosis-workflow
description: Use when Codex needs to run a staged bioinformatics diagnosis or mechanism workflow from Word方案文档 through requirements extraction, data/result matching, analysis planning, project code generation, manual task handoff, Word report generation, and report QC for single-cell, transcriptome, bulk, multi-omics, or client self-sequenced projects.

# 生物信息诊断工作流

Use this skill for diagnosis/mechanism bioinformatics projects that start from a Word `.docx` proposal and need staged analysis planning, project code generation, result review, and Word report generation.

## Required Dependency

- Also use the installed `docx` skill for every `.docx` operation, including proposal parsing, report template reading, and report writing.
- Treat Word proposal documents as the source of truth.
- Embedded Word images in proposals are reference/example figures unless the text explicitly says they are real results.

## Core Rules

- Follow the integrated department execution and analysis standard in `references/department-bioinformatics-standard.md` for directory layout, script reproducibility, data rules, module thresholds, reporting, review, and delivery.
- Default to staged execution. 每个阶段完成后暂停，等待用户确认再继续。
- Use Markdown plus `manifest.csv` outputs as user-facing artifacts; JSON is not a primary deliverable.
- Create and update `workflow/PROJECT_MEMORY.md` for each project.
- Generate project-specific code from templates when possible.
- Generated R analysis scripts must be named `r.{{step_num}}_{{step_name}}.R`, and their matching result directory must be `{{step_num}}_{{step_name}}`.
- Every generated R analysis script must start from this directory template, then perform all work inside `res_folder`:

```r
rm(list = ls()); gc()
pwd <- "{{PROJECT_DIR}}"
res_folder <- "{{step_num}}_{{step_name}}"

setwd(pwd)

if (!dir.exists(paths = file.path(res_folder))) {
  dir.create(res_folder)
}

setwd(res_folder)
```
- For large single-cell or long-running tasks, run only temporary smoke tests, delete temporary test data/logs, and hand off full execution to the user.
- Do not keep temporary smoke-test data, logs, or pass/fail records in the project directory.
- Final report filenames must use `report/<项目编号>_<YYYYMMDD>_report.docx`, with `_v2`, `_v3`, etc. to avoid overwrites.
- Word reports use the formatting, section structure, page breaks, highlighting, tables, and fixed 19-item QC checklist defined in `references/report-template-map.md`.
- Word reports insert PNG images only. Images and captions are centered; captions use black five-size type（五号）and no standalone light-blue image-name line is added.

## Workflow

1. Parse proposal DOCX with the `docx` skill and `scripts/extract_docx_outline.py`.
2. Write `workflow/01_requirements.md` and `workflow/01_requirements_manifest.csv`; pause.
3. Check requirements against provided data/result directories; write `workflow/02_gap_check.md` and `workflow/02_gap_check_manifest.csv`; pause.
4. Generate `workflow/03_analysis_plan.md` and `workflow/03_analysis_manifest.csv`; pause.
5. Generate project code from `templates/code/`; run only safe automatic analyses or smoke tests; write `workflow/04_generated_code.md` and `workflow/04_code_manifest.csv`; pause.
6. Write `workflow/05_manual_tasks.md` and `workflow/05_manual_manifest.csv` for long-running or non-code-stable modules; pause.
7. Scan results and prepare `workflow/06_report_inputs.md` and `workflow/06_report_manifest.csv`; pause.
8. Generate Word report using `templates/报告模板新2026.6.29.docx` and the `docx` skill; pause.
9. Run report QC and write `workflow/07_report_qc.md`.
